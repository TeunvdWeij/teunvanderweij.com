## About me {#about-me style="color: #34495e; border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 5px"}

I am an AI safety researcher, currently working as a Resident at Mantic. We are building an AI superforecaster, and my role is best be described as a research scientist.

Before Mantic, I focused on strategic underperformance on evaluations (sandbagging) by AI systems. This started MATS, and I continued working on this with a grant from the AI Safety Fund from the Frontier Model Forum.

I'm also a co-founder and board member at ENAIS (European Network for AI Safety), working to improve AI safety activities and coordination in Europe.

[arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.01784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01784)

I supervised this paper. Adding noise is a very interesting idea, and further experiments are needed to see if this can be used to robustly and accurately detect sandbagging.

I am most proud of this paper, and I think it's my most impactful work so far. It's great to see our work being used in both technical and governance contexts, inspiring groups at prominent AI safety organizations.

This paper was very helpful in improving my technical skills, both in conducting experiments and in understanding transformers. The paper contains some interesting ideas, but it's impact is limited.

My first project in AI safety. In some small experiments, we showed that GPT-4 has the capability to reason correctly about avoiding shutdown in certain scenarios, and actually does this in some cases.

## Activity highlights {#activity-highlights style="color: #34495e; border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 5px"}

### Moderator of a Q&A
I moderated a Q&A event with (ex-)OpenAI and Alignment Research Center researchers (Jeff Wu, Jacob Hilton, and Daniel Kokotajlo). We had over 1,800 people attending the event on existential risks posed by AI.

### Presentations
I have presented at various events on AI safety and related topics. Topics include AI sandbagging, how to contribute to AI safety without doing technical research, and more. 

If you want me to present at your event, feel free to reach out. I might charge a fee for the presentation based on the event, but I am happy to discuss this.
ure Selection Methods.* Research in Computing Science, 150(8), 138-150.

### Field-building 
My work at ENAIS is the best example of helping to support the field, but I have also helped organize events like the Dutch AI Safety Retreat.


## Outside of work {#outside-of-work style="color: #34495e; border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db; padding-bottom: 5px"}
I enjoy listening to music, so I go to concerts and festivals quite regularly. I listen to many genres, but my current two favorites are reggae and trance.

I like travelling too, so I try to visit new places when I can. Some favorites are the Nordics, Australia, and Zimbabwe.

Nature is nice too, and I mostly enjoying running, hiking, and snowboarding. Most recently I have gotten into splitboarding.
