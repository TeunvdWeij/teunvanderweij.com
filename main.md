## About Me {style="color: #34495e"}

I am an AI safety researcher currently working as a MATS Scholar, focusing on strategic underperformance on evaluations (sandbagging) of general purpose AI. I'm also a co-founder and board member of ENAIS (European Network for AI Safety), working to improve coordination between AI Safety researchers and policymakers in Europe.
